CSC 172 Lab 2 - This lab was an experimental analysis of the time complexity of multiple algorithms. Two different algorithms to find the number of pairs of integers that sum to 0 from a file of integers were run to find their time complexity. The same was done for two different algorithms finding triplets of integers that sum to 0. Graphs were made of the time complexities and outputs were logged in the OUTPUT file in this repository.
